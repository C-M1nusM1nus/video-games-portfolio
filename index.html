  <h1>Video Game Design & AI Game Evaluation</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">
    Portfolio focused on gameplay analysis, systems critique, and AI-generated game evaluation.
  </p>
  <p>
    This portfolio demonstrates my approach to evaluating video games through the lens of
    mechanics, player experience, and systemic design. The analyses emphasize identifying where
    games succeed, where they fall short, and how structured feedback can guide both human and
    AI-driven iteration.

  <h2>AI-Generated Games: Evaluation & Judgment</h2>

  <div class="game">
    <div class="game-header">
      <img src="images/slipstream-runner.png" alt="Slipstream Runner gameplay screenshot">
      <div class="game-title">
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/C-M1nusM1nus/Slipstream-Runner">Slipstream Runner</a></h3>
        <p><em>Momentum-Based Platformer — Mechanically Sound, Experientially Under-Tuned</em></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Slipstream Runner succeeds in establishing a clear gameplay identity centered on speed and
      flow. Players immediately understand their objective, and the game introduces mechanics
      incrementally, reducing onboarding friction.
    </p>

    <h4>Movement & Game Feel</h4>
    <p>
      While the game emphasizes momentum, the underlying movement tuning results in a slippery,
      low-friction feel that limits precision. Players often feel as though they are reacting to
      motion rather than actively controlling it.
    </p>

    <h4>Mechanic Interaction</h4>
    <p>
      Core mechanics—jumping, dashing, and wall interactions—exist alongside one another but do not
      strongly reinforce each other, lowering the overall skill ceiling.
    </p>

    <h4>Feedback & Readability</h4>
    <p>
      Momentum feedback is communicated through dramatic background color shifts. While effective
      initially, this becomes visually distracting during extended play sessions.
    </p>

    <h4>Overall Assessment</h4>
    <p>
      Slipstream Runner illustrates a common AI-generation pattern: the game functions correctly
      but lacks the fine-tuning needed to achieve satisfying mastery.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="game">
    <div class="game-header">
      <img src="images/signal-lost.png" alt="Signal Lost puzzle gameplay screenshot">
      <div class="game-title">
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/C-M1nusM1nus/Signal-Lost">Signal Lost</a></h3>
        <p><em>Indie-Scale Puzzle Game — Cohesive, Polished, and Extensible</em></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Signal Lost presents a tightly scoped puzzle experience with consistent rules and strong
      feedback loops that support thoughtful problem-solving.
    </p>

    <h4>Core Loop & Puzzle Design</h4>
    <p>
      The rotation-based signal mechanic provides immediate and readable feedback, reinforcing
      learning without excessive trial-and-error.
    </p>

    <h4>Progression & Difficulty</h4>
    <p>
      Mechanics are introduced gradually and combined logically, ensuring difficulty increases
      through complexity rather than restriction.
    </p>

    <h4>Feedback & Polish</h4>
    <p>
      Sound effects and visual cues enhance clarity and player engagement without overwhelming
      the experience.
    </p>

    <h4>Overall Assessment</h4>
    <p>
      Signal Lost exemplifies how focused scope and thoughtful design can produce a complete,
      extensible indie game experience.

  <h2>Game Systems Dissection & Community-Informed Evaluation</h2>

  <div class="game">
    <div class="game-header">
      <img src="images/minecraft.jpg" alt="Minecraft gameplay screenshot">
      <div class="game-title">
        <h3>Minecraft</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Minecraft’s core strength lies in its systemic simplicity enabling extreme emergent
      complexity. By combining a small set of mechanics—block placement, crafting, physics,
      and environmental interaction—the game empowers players to define their own goals.
    </p>

    <h4>Core Systems & Emergence</h4>
    <p>
      Players consistently praise the way simple rules scale into complex creations. Redstone,
      farming systems, and large-scale builds emerge naturally rather than being explicitly
      designed objectives. This openness fosters creativity but also places responsibility
      on the player to self-motivate.
    </p>

    <h4>Progression & Motivation</h4>
    <p>
      Community feedback often highlights a lack of structured mid- and late-game goals.
      While early survival progression is clear, many players report a motivational drop-off
      once core resources are secured, unless self-directed challenges are adopted.
    </p>

    <h4>Combat & Feedback</h4>
    <p>
      Combat is frequently cited as functional but shallow relative to other systems.
      Enemy behaviors are predictable, and combat feedback lacks the depth found in
      building and exploration mechanics.
    </p>

    <h4>Overall Assessment</h4>
    <p>
      Minecraft exemplifies the power of emergent design while illustrating the tradeoff
      between player freedom and directed engagement. Its systems succeed as a sandbox,
      but benefit from player-created structure rather than intrinsic pacing.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="game">
    <div class="game-header">
      <img src="images/undertale.png" alt="Undertale gameplay screenshot">
      <div class="game-title">
        <h3>Undertale</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Undertale is widely regarded as a landmark example of narrative-driven design, where
      mechanics reinforce emotional themes rather than existing independently of them.
    </p>

    <h4>Mechanics as Narrative Devices</h4>
    <p>
      Combat systems double as storytelling tools. Choices made during encounters affect
      character relationships and long-term outcomes, encouraging players to consider
      empathy and consequence rather than optimization alone.
    </p>

    <h4>Player Choice & Emotional Impact</h4>
    <p>
      Community discussion frequently highlights how player decisions feel personally
      acknowledged by the game. The world reacts persistently, creating emotional weight
      rarely seen in traditional RPG structures.
    </p>

    <h4>Replayability & Constraints</h4>
    <p>
      Some players note reduced replay value after experiencing major narrative paths.
      Once the emotional arc is complete, mechanical depth alone may not sustain extended play.
    </p>

    <h4>Overall Assessment</h4>
    <p>
      Undertale succeeds by tightly integrating narrative and mechanics. While limited in scope,
      it demonstrates how deliberate design choices can produce lasting emotional resonance.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="game">
    <div class="game-header">
      <img src="images/ninja-gaiden.jpg" alt="Ninja Gaiden NES gameplay screenshot">
      <div class="game-title">
        <h3>Ninja Gaiden (NES)</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Ninja Gaiden is remembered as a defining example of high-difficulty action design
      from the NES era, emphasizing mastery through repetition and precision.
    </p>

    <h4>Control Precision & Skill Ceiling</h4>
    <p>
      Players praise the responsiveness of movement and attacks. Success depends on timing,
      positioning, and memorization, rewarding disciplined execution over improvisation.
    </p>

    <h4>Difficulty & Frustration</h4>
    <p>
      Enemy respawns and sudden spawn placement are commonly cited as punitive rather than
      instructive. Knockback into hazards often results in instant failure, which some
      players interpret as artificial difficulty.
    </p>

    <h4>Learning Curve</h4>
    <p>
      Despite its harshness, players report a strong sense of accomplishment once patterns
      are learned. The game teaches through failure, though at the cost of accessibility.
    </p>

    <h4>Overall Assessment</h4>
    <p>
      Ninja Gaiden exemplifies the fine line between rewarding challenge and player frustration.
      Its design prioritizes mastery but risks alienating players unfamiliar with retro
      difficulty conventions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="game">
    <div class="game-header">
      <img src="images/fortnite.jpg" alt="Fortnite gameplay screenshot">
      <div class="game-title">
        <h3>Fortnite</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Fortnite distinguishes itself through the integration of real-time building mechanics
      into a competitive shooter framework, dramatically increasing mechanical depth.
    </p>

    <h4>Core Loop & Skill Expression</h4>
    <p>
      Building enables rapid expression of skill, allowing players to create cover, mobility,
      and offensive advantages dynamically. High-level play emphasizes speed, spatial awareness,
      and mechanical precision.
    </p>

    <h4>Accessibility vs. Mastery</h4>
    <p>
      Community feedback frequently notes the widening gap between casual and competitive players.
      As the meta evolves, new players may struggle to engage meaningfully without extensive practice.
    </p>

    <h4>Live-Service Design</h4>
    <p>
      Frequent updates, events, and mechanical shifts keep the experience fresh but can
      destabilize learned skills. This creates tension between innovation and consistency.
    </p>

    <h4>Overall Assessment</h4>
    <p>
      Fortnite demonstrates how live-service systems can sustain long-term engagement while
      introducing challenges in balancing accessibility, stability, and competitive depth.
    </p>
