  <h1>Video Game Design & AI Game Evaluation</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">
    Portfolio focused on gameplay analysis, systems critique, and AI-generated game evaluation.
  </p>
  <p>
    This portfolio demonstrates my approach to evaluating video games through the lens of
    mechanics, player experience, and systemic design. The analyses emphasize identifying where
    games succeed, where they fall short, and how structured feedback can guide both human and
    AI-driven iteration.

  <h2>AI-Generated Games: Evaluation & Judgment</h2>

  <div class="game">
    <div class="game-header">
      <img src="images/slipstream-runner.png" alt="Slipstream Runner gameplay screenshot">
      <div class="game-title">
        <h3>Slipstream Runner</h3>
        <p><em>Momentum-Based Platformer — Mechanically Sound, Experientially Under-Tuned</em></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Slipstream Runner succeeds in establishing a clear gameplay identity centered on speed and
      flow. Players immediately understand their objective, and the game introduces mechanics
      incrementally, reducing onboarding friction.
    </p>

    <h4>Movement & Game Feel</h4>
    <p>
      While the game emphasizes momentum, the underlying movement tuning results in a slippery,
      low-friction feel that limits precision. Players often feel as though they are reacting to
      motion rather than actively controlling it.
    </p>

    <h4>Mechanic Interaction</h4>
    <p>
      Core mechanics—jumping, dashing, and wall interactions—exist alongside one another but do not
      strongly reinforce each other, lowering the overall skill ceiling.
    </p>

    <h4>Feedback & Readability</h4>
    <p>
      Momentum feedback is communicated through dramatic background color shifts. While effective
      initially, this becomes visually distracting during extended play sessions.
    </p>

    <h4>Overall Assessment</h4>
    <p>
      Slipstream Runner illustrates a common AI-generation pattern: the game functions correctly
      but lacks the fine-tuning needed to achieve satisfying mastery.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="game">
    <div class="game-header">
      <img src="images/signal-lost.png" alt="Signal Lost puzzle gameplay screenshot">
      <div class="game-title">
        <h3>Signal Lost</h3>
        <p><em>Indie-Scale Puzzle Game — Cohesive, Polished, and Extensible</em></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Signal Lost presents a tightly scoped puzzle experience with consistent rules and strong
      feedback loops that support thoughtful problem-solving.
    </p>

    <h4>Core Loop & Puzzle Design</h4>
    <p>
      The rotation-based signal mechanic provides immediate and readable feedback, reinforcing
      learning without excessive trial-and-error.
    </p>

    <h4>Progression & Difficulty</h4>
    <p>
      Mechanics are introduced gradually and combined logically, ensuring difficulty increases
      through complexity rather than restriction.
    </p>

    <h4>Feedback & Polish</h4>
    <p>
      Sound effects and visual cues enhance clarity and player engagement without overwhelming
      the experience.
    </p>

    <h4>Overall Assessment</h4>
    <p>
      Signal Lost exemplifies how focused scope and thoughtful design can produce a complete,
      extensible indie game experience.

  <h2>Game Systems Dissection & Community-Informed Evaluation</h2>

  <div class="game">
    <div class="game-header">
      <img src="images/minecraft.jpg" alt="Minecraft gameplay screenshot">
      <div class="game-title">
        <h3>Minecraft</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Minecraft’s strength lies in emergent gameplay enabled by simple mechanics. Community
      feedback consistently praises player freedom while noting weaknesses in combat depth
      and long-term structured goals.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="game">
    <div class="game-header">
      <img src="images/undertale.png" alt="Undertale gameplay screenshot">
      <div class="game-title">
        <h3>Undertale</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Undertale integrates narrative and mechanics in a way that makes player choice emotionally
      meaningful. Some players cite limited replayability, but its storytelling impact remains
      widely respected.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="game">
    <div class="game-header">
      <img src="images/ninja-gaiden.jpg" alt="Ninja Gaiden NES gameplay screenshot">
      <div class="game-title">
        <h3>Ninja Gaiden (NES)</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Ninja Gaiden is praised for precision and challenge, though its enemy placement and knockback
      mechanics are often cited as frustrating rather than instructive.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="game">
    <div class="game-header">
      <img src="images/fortnite.jpg" alt="Fortnite gameplay screenshot">
      <div class="game-title">
        <h3>Fortnite</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Fortnite’s build system creates an exceptionally high skill ceiling. Community discussion
      often centers on balancing accessibility with competitive depth.

  <h2>AI-Specific Design Insight</h2>
  <p>
    Evaluating both AI-generated and human-designed games reveals that technical correctness alone
    does not guarantee engagement. Subtle tuning, feedback clarity, and system cohesion are critical.
  </p>
  <p>
    This portfolio reflects the type of structured judgment required to help AI systems produce
    more compelling and innovative video game experiences.
