  <h1>Video Game Design & AI Game Evaluation</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">
    Portfolio focused on gameplay analysis, systems critique, and AI-generated game evaluation.
  </p>
  <p>
    I specialize in evaluating video game mechanics, player experience, and design systems with
    an emphasis on improving AI-generated game content through structured feedback and iteration.

  <h2>Project 1: AI-Generated Games — Evaluation & Judgment</h2>

  <h3>Slipstream Runner</h3>
  <p><em>Momentum-Based Platformer — Functional but in Need of Refinement</em></p>

  <p>
    Slipstream Runner is a technically functional momentum-based platformer that successfully
    implements its core mechanics and progression structure. The game communicates its objectives
    clearly and introduces mechanics gradually, creating a smooth onboarding experience.
  </p>

  <h4>Strengths</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Intuitive controls and clear objectives</li>
    <li>Gradual introduction of mechanics</li>
    <li>Predictable and readable difficulty progression</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Identified Issues</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Movement feels overly slippery, reducing precision and player confidence</li>
    <li>Momentum feedback relies on aggressive background color changes that distract from gameplay</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Design Takeaways</h4>
  <p>
    Slipstream Runner demonstrates a common pattern in AI-generated games: the design works as
    intended but lacks the subtle tuning required to elevate game feel. Refining friction,
    air control, and visual feedback would significantly improve the experience without major
    structural changes.
  </p>

  <h3>Signal Lost</h3>
  <p><em>Indie-Scale Puzzle Game — Cohesive and Well-Designed</em></p>

  <p>
    Signal Lost is a polished puzzle game that effectively balances clarity, challenge, and
    engagement. Its mechanics are intuitive, and its progression introduces complexity gradually
    without overwhelming the player.
  </p>

  <h4>Strengths</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Clear core objective and intuitive controls</li>
    <li>Logical and fair difficulty progression</li>
    <li>Audio feedback that enhances interactivity</li>
    <li>Strong sense of completeness despite small scope</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Design Takeaways</h4>
  <p>
    Signal Lost demonstrates how focused mechanics, strong feedback systems, and thoughtful
    progression can produce a satisfying experience. Its design foundation is robust and easily
    extensible through additional content or mechanics.

  <h2>Game Systems Dissection & Community-Informed Evaluation</h2>

  <h3>Minecraft</h3>
  <p>
    Minecraft is widely praised for its unmatched player freedom and emergent gameplay. Simple
    mechanics combine to create near-infinite creative possibilities, supported by a strong
    modding ecosystem.
  </p>
  <p>
    Common critiques focus on weak structured progression after early milestones and relatively
    shallow combat systems.
  </p>

  <h3>Undertale</h3>
  <p>
    Undertale is celebrated for its emotionally impactful narrative and its integration of
    storytelling into gameplay mechanics. Players consistently cite its characters and music
    as defining strengths.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some players note limited replay appeal once major narrative paths are completed and find
    its tonal style polarizing.
  </p>

  <h3>Ninja Gaiden (NES)</h3>
  <p>
    Ninja Gaiden is recognized for its high skill ceiling and responsive controls. Mastery is
    rewarding, and its cinematic presentation was groundbreaking for its era.
  </p>
  <p>
    Community critiques frequently highlight punishing difficulty spikes and limited recovery
    from mistakes, which can lead to frustration.
  </p>

  <h3>Fortnite</h3>
  <p>
    Fortnite’s build-and-combat system differentiates it from other shooters and rewards high
    mechanical skill. Ongoing content updates sustain long-term engagement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Players often cite the growing skill gap and rapidly shifting meta as barriers to casual
    enjoyment.

  <h2>AI-Specific Design Insight</h2>
  <p>
    Across both AI-generated and human-designed games, a consistent pattern emerges:
    technical correctness alone does not guarantee player engagement. Subtle tuning, feedback
    clarity, and system cohesion are essential to transforming functional designs into compelling
    experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    These evaluations demonstrate how expert judgment and structured critique can guide AI
    systems toward producing more engaging, balanced, and innovative video game content.
